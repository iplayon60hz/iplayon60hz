!ABOUT ME!
my name is jade and im 18 years old. i love making new stuff, im currently working on a psx style game. i also make music, and i always enjoy learning new things. my goal is to essentially become megamind without the huge forehead
once my game is done, it will be released on itch.io for you to play. right now i am currently developing the levels and will start working on the npc dialogue within a few weeks
i also am a huge fan of investing. i usually invest in limited edition items as they become high demand, this could be sneakers, game items etc. i also run a shop and stream occasionally. my shop makes me around 250 a month right now which is awesome
i love taking public transport, especially trains and trams. after a long day its relaxing for me to catch an empty tram and watch the city
if you want to communicate with me, my discord is pre#0155

thanks for reading this c:
